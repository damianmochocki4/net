1. A folder with subfolders that have files in them has to be selected (folder name doesn't matter).
2. The name for the summary Excel file is taken from a selected directory path, from a folder name starting with "Re". If there is no such folder, the summary Excel will be named "Inventory.xlsx".
3. After completion, there's a pop-up window informing of the number of subfolders processed and the directory of the summary Excel.
